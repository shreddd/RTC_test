# Live Coding Exercises

This is a set of coding exercises in Python. We are using the experimental real-time collaboration features of Jupyter to set up a common live editing session, so we can all edit text in the same notebook / doc.

## Exercise 1 - Warm Up

Open up count9.ipynb, and follow the instructions.

## Exercise 2 - Class Design

Open up Elevator.ipynb, and follow the instructions.
